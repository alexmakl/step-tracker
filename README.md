# Step Tracker
Step Tracker integrates Apple Health to show your latest step and weight data in animated, interactive Swift Charts. 
You can also see your average steps and weight gain/loss for each weekday for the past 28 days.

Step Tracker also allows you to upload new step or weight data to the Apple Health app.
